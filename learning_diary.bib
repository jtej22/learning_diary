  abstract = {Mechanistic explanations of herbivore spatial distribution have focused largely on either resource-related (bottom-up) or predation-related (top-down) factors. We studied direct and indirect influences on the spatial distributions of Serengeti herbivore hotspots, defined as temporally stable areas inhabited by mixed herds of resident grazers. Remote sensing and variation in landscape features were first used to create a map of the spatial distribution of hotspots, which was tested for accuracy against an independent data set of herbivore observations. Subsequently, we applied structural equation modeling to data on soil fertility and plant quality and quantity across a range of sites. We found that hotspots in Serengeti occur in areas that are relatively flat and located away from rivers, sites where ungulates are less susceptible to predation. Further, hotspots tend to occur in areas where hydrology and rainfall create conditions of relatively low-standing plant biomass, which, coupled with grazing, increases forage quality while decreasing predation risk. Low-standing biomass and higher leaf concentrations of N, Na, and Mg were strong direct predictors of hotspot occurrence. Soil fertility had indirect effects on hotspot occurrence by promoting leaf Na and Mg. The results indicate that landscape features contribute in direct and indirect ways to influence the spatial distribution of hotspots and that the best models incorporated both resource- and predation-related factors. Our study highlights the collective and simultaneous role of bottom-up and top-down factors in determining ungulate spatial distributions.},

  abstract = {We used evolutionary programming to model innate migratory pathways of wildebeest in the Serengeti Mara Ecosystem, Tanzania and Kenya. Wildebeest annually move from the southern short-grass plains of the Serengeti to the northern woodlands of the Mara. We used satellite images to create 12 average monthly and 180 10-day surfaces from 1998 to 2003 of percentage rainfall and new vegetation. The surfaces were combined in five additive and three multiplicative models, with the weightings on rainfall and new vegetation from 0\% to 100\%. Modeled wildebeest were first assigned random migration pathways. In simulated generations, animals best able to access rainfall and vegetation were retained, and they produced offspring with similar migratory pathways. Modeling proceeded until the best pathway was stable. In a learning phase, modeling continued with the ten-day images in the objective function. The additive model, influenced 25\% by rainfall and 75\% by vegetation growth, yielded the best agreement, with a multi-resolution comparison to observed densities yielding 76.8\% of blocks in agreement (kappa = 0.32). Agreement was best for dry season and early wet season (kappa = 0.22-0.57), and poorest for the late wet season (0.04). The model suggests that new forage growth is a dominant correlate of wildebeest migration.},

  abstract = {The need for data integration for providing multi-image and up-to-date geo-information requires a careful quality assessment of image registration. This paper deals with remote sensing scanning images to be registered by a least-squares polynomial trend model transformation, under the supposition that plane coordinate systems of master and slave are sufficient. A threefold basic hypothesis and four model assumptions are posed holding that in the ‘ideal’ case the residuals after execution of the transformation are showing only the random component of the transformation. In addition to some earlier published quantitative measures and two statistical tests, in this paper it is proposed to analyze the geometrical behaviour of the so-called ‘plot of centred residual pairs’ with respect to possible deviations from the hypothesis of randomness of the residuals. In this line the Ajne test and the Moore test, common in circular biology, look for the existence of a ‘preference axis’. Furthermore, the Spearman rank correlation test is proposed as another method to detect possible structure which can be left after the transformation. The use of these tests and the distinct effects are demonstrated by means of some examples. It is concluded that the implementation of the proposed tests in addition to other possibilities of testing and analysis, deepens the insight in an actual registration case and improves the quality assessment of remote sensing image registration in general.},

Among the different sea targets of interest, low-backscattering areas are often associated to marine oil pollution even if several physical phenomena may also result in low-backscattering patches at sea. In this study, the effects of low-backscattering areas of anthropogenic and natural origin on the azimuth autocorrelation function (AACF) are analyzed using VV-polarized SAR measurements. Two objective metrics are introduced to quantify the deviation of the AACF evaluated over low-backscattering areas with reference to slick-free sea surface. Experiments, undertaken on six Sentinel-1 SAR scenes, collected in Interferometric Wide Swath VV+VH imaging mode over large low-backscattering areas of different origin under low-to-moderate wind conditions (speed ≤ 7 m/s), spanning a wide range of incidence angles (from about 30° up to 46°), demonstrated that the AACF evaluated within low-backscattering sea areas remarkably deviates from the slick-free sea surface one and the largest deviation is observed over oil slicks.},

  abstract = {Urban green spaces are known to provide ample benefits to human society and hence play a vital role in safeguarding the quality of life in our cities. In order to optimize the design and management of green spaces with regard to the provisioning of these ecosystem services, there is a clear need for uniform and spatially explicit datasets on the existing urban green infrastructure. Current mapping approaches, however, largely focus on large land use units (e.g., park, garden), or broad land cover classes (e.g., tree, grass), not providing sufficient thematic detail to model urban ecosystem service supply. We therefore proposed a functional urban green typology and explored the potential of both passive (2 m-hyperspectral and 0.5 m-multispectral optical imagery) and active (airborne LiDAR) remote sensing technology for mapping the proposed types using object-based image analysis and machine learning. Airborne LiDAR data was found to be the most valuable dataset overall, while fusion with hyperspectral data was essential for mapping the most detailed classes. High spectral similarities, along with adjacency and shadow effects still caused severe confusion, resulting in class-wise accuracies {$<$}50\% for some detailed functional types. Further research should focus on the use of multi-temporal image analysis to fully unlock the potential of remote sensing data for detailed urban green mapping.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is one of the fundamental economic activities in most countries; however, this sector suffers from various natural hazards including flood and drought. The determination of drought-prone areas is essential to select drought-tolerant crops in climate sensitive vulnerable areas. This study aims to enhance the detection of agricultural areas with vulnerability to drought conditions in a heterogeneous environment, taking Bangladesh as a case study. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images have been incorporated to compute the vegetation index. In this study, a modified vegetation condition index (mVCI) is proposed to enhance the estimation of agricultural drought. The NDVI values ranging between 0.44 to 0.66 for croplands are utilized for the mVCI. The outcomes of the mVCI are compared with the traditional vegetation condition index (VCI). Precipitation and crop yield data are used for the evaluation. The mVCI maps from multiple years (2006–2018) have been produced to compute the drought hazard index (DHI) using a weighted sum overlay method. The results show that the proposed mVCI enhances the detection of agricultural drought compared to the traditional VCI in a heterogeneous environment. The “Aus” rice-growing season (sown in mid-March to mid-April and harvested in mid-July to early August) receives the highest average precipitation ({$>$}400 mm), and thereby this season is less vulnerable to drought. A comparison of crop yields reveals the lowest productivity in the drought year (2006) compared to the non-drought year (2018), and the DHI map presents that the north-west region of Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to agricultural drought. This study has undertaken a large-scale analysis that is important to prioritize agricultural zones and initiate development projects based on the associated level of vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Addressing global declines in biodiversity requires accurate assessments of key environmental attributes determining patterns of species diversity. Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation strongly affects species diversity patterns, and measures of vegetation structure derived from lidar and satellite image texture analysis correlate well with species richness. Our goal here was to gain a better understanding of why image texture explains bird richness, by linking field-based measures of vegetation structure directly with both image texture and bird richness. In addition, we asked how image texture compares with lidar-based canopy height variability, and how sensor resolution affects the explanatory power of image texture. We generated texture metrics from 30~m (Landsat 8) and 10~m (Sentinel-2) resolution Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery from 2017 to 2019. We compared textures with vegetation metrics and bird richness data from 27 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial field sites across the continental US. Both 30 and 10~m resolution texture metrics were strongly correlated with lidar-based canopy height variability (|r|~=~0.64 and 0.80, respectively). Texture was moderately correlated with field-based metrics, including variability of vegetation height and tree stem diameter, and foliage height diversity (range |r|~=~0.31–0.52). Generally, 10~m resolution texture had stronger correlations with lidar and field-based metrics than 30~m resolution texture. In univariate linear models of total bird richness, 10~m resolution texture metrics also had higher explanatory power (up to R2adj~=~0.45), than 30~m texture metrics (up to R2adj~=~0.31). Among all metrics evaluated, the 10~m homogeneity texture was the best univariate predictor of total bird richness. In multivariate bird richness models that combined texture with lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based metrics, both 30~m and 10~m resolution texture metrics were selected in top-ranked models and independently contributed explanatory power (up to R2adj~=~46\%). Lidar-based canopy height variability was also selected in a top-ranked model of total bird richness, but independently contributed only 15\% of the variance explained. Our results show satellite image texture characterized multiple features of structural and compositional vegetation heterogeneity, complemented more commonly used metrics in models of bird richness and for some guilds outperformed both lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based vegetation measurements. Ours is the first study to directly link image texture both to specific components of vegetation heterogeneity and to bird richness across multiple ecoregions and spatial resolutions, thereby shedding light on habitat features underlying the strong correlation between image texture and biodiversity.},

Earlier versions of this global coverage 15-day composite dataset have been used for numerous local to global scale vegetation time series studies during recent years. However, several aspects of the AVHRR sensor design and data processing potentially introduce substantial noise into the NDVI dataset if not corrected for. The more recent NDVI dataset from Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is considered an improvement over AVHRR data and with the release of GIMMS3g an overlapping period of 11years now provides a possibility to perform a robust evaluation of the accuracy of GIMMS3g data and derived trends. In this study the accuracy is evaluated by comparison with the global Terra MODIS NDVI (MOD13C2 Collection 5) data using linear regression trend analysis. The trends of GIMMS NDVI were found to be in overall acceptable agreement with MODIS NDVI data. A significant trend in NDVI (α=0.05) was found for 11.8\% of the MODIS NDVI pixels on a global scale (5.4\% characterised by positive trends and 6.3 with negative trends) whereas GIMMS NDVI analysis produced a total of 10.5\% significant pixels (4.9\% positive, 5.6\% negative). However, larger differences were found for the Southern Hemisphere land masses (South America and Australia) and the high northern latitude Arctic regions. From a linear regression analysis the correlation coefficient between the two datasets was found to be highly significant for areas with a distinct phenological cycle. Discrepancies between the GIMMS and MODIS datasets were found in equatorial areas (broadleaved, evergreen forest), Arctic areas (sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub cover) and arid areas (herbaceous cover, closed–open). Linear regression of QA filtered Terra and Aqua MODIS NDVI (2003–2010) revealed similar inconsistencies for Arctic and equatorial areas suggesting that robust long-term NDVI trend estimates in these areas are difficult to obtain from both GIMMS and MODIS data. Additionally, GIMMS based NDVI trend analysis in arid areas of limited photosynthetic activity should be interpreted with caution. The regression coefficient (slope value) (p{$<$}0.01) was found to be close to 1 for most land cover types on a global scale (global land cover class average slope=1.00) suggesting overall compatibility between MODIS and GIMMS NDVI, but with land cover class specific variations (within class and between classes).},

The relationship between urban biophysical and thermal conditions, and LULC is generally known; however, the absence of a dense network of land-based meteorological stations is an obstacle to the comparison of LST to Major Air Pollutants (MAP). Method This research proposes investigation of the relationships between LST derived by Sentinel-3 SLSTR, MAP derived by Sentinel-5 Precursor, and air pollution monitoring system stations in Tehran province, Iran. The method is designed in a moving average model with the use of a Python application programming interface, geographical information system, and remote sensing. Result The mean concentration of the Particulate Matter (PM), Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) are mainly in the Tehran metropolis and the core urban area. A negative correlation was noted between the PM₂.₅, SO₂, NO₂, and altitude. Additionally, increased altitude negatively affects LST, Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O₃) values; whereas, CO and O₃ have positive correlations with LST, representing the mutual impacts of LST, CO, and O₃ values in Tehran province.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

  abstract = {This study evaluated how spectral resolution of high-spatial resolution optical remote sensing data influences detailed mapping of urban land cover. A comprehensive regional spectral library and low altitude data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were used to characterize the spectral properties of urban land cover. The Bhattacharyya distance was applied as a measure of spectral separability to determine a most suitable subset of 14 AVIRIS bands for urban mapping. We evaluated the performance of this spectral setting versus common multispectral sensors such as Ikonos by assessing classification accuracy for 26 urban land cover classes. Significant limitations for current multispectral sensors were identified, where the location and broadband character of the spectral bands only marginally resolved the complex spectral characteristics of the urban environment, especially for built surface types. However, the AVIRIS classification accuracy did not exceed 66.6\% for 22 urban cover types, primarily due to spectral similarities of specific urban materials and high within-class variability.},

  abstract = {We present a novel and innovative automated processing environment for the derivation of land cover (LC) and land use (LU) information. This processing framework named TWOPAC (TWinned Object and Pixel based Automated classification Chain) enables the standardized, independent, user-friendly, and comparable derivation of LC and LU information, with minimized manual classification labor. TWOPAC allows classification of multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing imagery from different sensor types. TWOPAC enables not only pixel-based classification, but also allows classification based on object-based characteristics. Classification is based on a Decision Tree approach (DT) for which the well-known C5.0 code has been implemented, which builds decision trees based on the concept of information entropy. TWOPAC enables automatic generation of the decision tree classifier based on a C5.0-retrieved ascii-file, as well as fully automatic validation of the classification output via sample based accuracy assessment.Envisaging the automated generation of standardized land cover products, as well as area-wide classification of large amounts of data in preferably a short processing time, standardized interfaces for process control, Web Processing Services (WPS), as introduced by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), are utilized. TWOPAC’s functionality to process geospatial raster or vector data via web resources (server, network) enables TWOPAC’s usability independent of any commercial client or desktop software and allows for large scale data processing on servers. Furthermore, the components of TWOPAC were built-up using open source code components and are implemented as a plug-in for Quantum GIS software for easy handling of the classification process from the user’s perspective.},

  abstract = {Urban greenspace is of high importance for the general public from different points of view. Among others, it is beneficial for recreational activities as well as for cooling effects during summer in urban climate. Many studies investigate urban greenspace from perspectives related to environmental justice or health geography that are usually based on environmental and sociodemographic data of diverse scales or spatial levels of detail and often suffer from high degrees of generalization. To demonstrate the benefit of a higher degree of spatial detail, a representative part of the city of Dortmund (Germany) is selected as study area. A time series of freely available Sentinel-2 images and a freely available digital object height model (DOHM) are used to analyze and describe the spatio-temporal distribution of urban vegetation and its potential effects on the population. Doing so, the Sentinel-2 images are used for the calculation of vegetation indices to identify the active green period of different vegetation land covers. In addition to that, the three-dimensional appearance of vegetation is correlated with the green period to assume the relevance of green land covers for the general public. The results show that an appropriate selection of cloud-free satellite images is of importance for a greenspace analysis. The combination of high resolution 2D and 3D data sets, namely NDVI and plant height information, reveals the spatial distribution of well-equipped greenspace areas with high recreational and health potential as well as poorly-equipped areas in urban neighborhoods, that could be improved.},

This research aimed at developing a method for slum detection based on the morphology of the built environment. The method consists of segmentation followed by hierarchical classification using object-oriented image analysis and integrating expert knowledge in the form of a local slum ontology. Results show that textural feature contrast derived from a grey-level co-occurrence matrix was useful for delineating segments of slum areas or parts thereof. Spatial metrics such as the size of segments and proportions of vegetation and built-up were used for slum detection. The percentage of agreement between the reference layer and slum classification was 60 percent. This is lower than the accuracy achieved for land cover classification (80.8 percent), due to large variations. We conclude that the method produces useful results and has potential for successful application in contexts with similar morphology.},

In this study, we explored the potential of bi-temporal WorldView-2 (WV2, acquired on 14 September 2012) and WorldView-3 images (WV3, acquired on 18 October 2014) for identifying five dominant urban tree species with the object-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) methods. Two study areas in Beijing, China, Capital Normal University (CNU) and Beijing Normal University (BNU), representing the typical urban environment, were evaluated. Three classification schemes—classification based solely on WV2; WV3; and bi-temporal WV2 and WV3 images—were examined. Our study showed that the single-date image did not produce satisfying classification results as both producer and user accuracies of tree species were relatively low (44.7\%–82.5\%), whereas those derived from bi-temporal images were on average 10.7\% higher. In addition, the overall accuracy increased substantially (9.7\%–20.2\% for the CNU area and 4.7\%–12\% for BNU). A thorough analysis concluded that near-infrared 2, red-edge and green bands are always more important than the other bands to classification, and spectral features always contribute more than textural features. Our results also showed that the scattered distribution of trees and a more complex surrounding environment reduced classification accuracy. Comparisons between SVM and RF classifiers suggested that SVM is more effective for urban tree species classification as it outperforms RF when working with a smaller amount and imbalanced distribution of samples.},

Western Australia has witnessed rapid economic expansion since the turn of the century founded upon extensive natural resource extraction. Thus, Perth, the state capital of Western Australia, has encountered significant population and urban growth in response to the booming state economy. However, the recent economic slowdown resulted in the largest decrease in natural resource values that Western Australia has ever experienced. Here, we present multi-temporal urban expansion statistics from 1990 to 2015 for Perth, derived from Landsat imagery. Current urban estimates used for future development plans and progress monitoring of infill and density targets are based upon aggregated census data and metrics unrepresentative of actual land cover change, underestimating overall urban area. Earth observation provides a temporally consistent methodology, identifying areal urban area at higher spatial and temporal resolution than current estimates. Our results indicate that the spatial extent of the Perth Metropolitan Region has increased 45\% between 1990 and 2015, over 320 km2. We highlight the applicability of earth observation data in accurately quantifying urban area for sustainable targeted planning practices.},

  abstract = {Green space is increasingly recognized as an important component of the urban environment. Adequate management and planning of urban green space is crucial to maximize its benefits for urban inhabitants and for the urban ecosystem in general. Inventorying urban vegetation is a costly and time-consuming process. The development of new remote sensing techniques to map and monitor vegetation has therefore become an important topic of interest to many scholars. Based on a comprehensive survey of the literature, this review article provides an overview of the main approaches proposed to map urban vegetation from high-resolution remotely sensed data. Studies are reviewed from three perspectives: (a) the vegetation typology, (b) the remote sensing data used and (c) the mapping approach applied. With regard to vegetation typology, a distinction is made between studies focusing on the mapping of functional vegetation types and studies performing mapping of lower-level taxonomic ranks, with the latter mainly focusing on urban trees. A wide variety of high-resolution imagery has been used by researchers for both types of mapping. The fusion of various types of remote sensing data, as well as the inclusion of phenological information through the use of multi-temporal imagery, prove to be the most promising avenues to improve mapping accuracy. With regard to mapping approaches, the use of deep learning is becoming more established, mostly for the mapping of tree species. Through this survey, several research gaps could be identified. Interest in the mapping of non-tree species in urban environments is still limited. The same holds for the mapping of understory species. Most studies focus on the mapping of public green spaces, while interest in the mapping of private green space is less common. The use of imagery with a high spatial and temporal resolution, enabling the retrieval of phenological information for mapping and monitoring vegetation at the species level, still proves to be limited in urban contexts. Hence, mapping approaches specifically tailored towards time-series analysis and the use of new data sources seem to hold great promise for advancing the field. Finally, unsupervised learning techniques and active learning, so far rarely applied in urban vegetation mapping, are also areas where significant progress can be expected.},

They can be applied to rectify both digitized aerial photographs and satellite scenes. These methods are polynomial, projective, and differential rectifications. The first two are defined by analytical transformations between image and orthophoto without considering the geometry and orientation of the camera. They are approximate solutions. The last one models the physical reality of the imaging process by means of the collinearity equations and corrects for relief displacements. For eliminating distortions of the camera system, additional parameters were included. This proves to be necessary when images are directly taken by video cameras. All three methods were implemented on a workstation and were tested with digitized aerial photographs and video images. By overlaying GIS data over the digital orthophoto, the quality of the rectification is checked. To determine the planimetric accuracy of the results, the coordinates of targets were measured in a digital orthophoto and compared to known map coordinates.},

  abstract = {Land cover classification of Landsat images is one of the most important applications developed from Earth observation satellites. The last four decades were marked by different developments in land cover classification methods of Landsat images. This paper reviews the developments in land cover classification methods for Landsat images from the 1970s to date and highlights key ways to optimize analysis of Landsat images in order to attain the desired results. This review suggests that the development of land cover classification methods grew alongside the launches of a new series of Landsat sensors and advancements in computer science. Most classification methods were initially developed in the 1970s and 1980s; however, many advancements in specific classifiers and algorithms have occurred in the last decade. The first methods of land cover classification to be applied to Landsat images were visual analyses in the early 1970s, followed by unsupervised and supervised pixel-based classification methods using maximum likelihood, K-means and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODAT) classifiers. After 1980, other methods such as sub-pixel, knowledge-based, contextual-based, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and hybrid approaches became common in land cover classification. Attaining the best classification results with Landsat images demands particular attention to the specifications of each classification method such as selecting the right training samples, choosing the appropriate segmentation scale for OBIA, pre-processing calibration, choosing the right classifier and using suitable Landsat images. All these classification methods applied on Landsat images have strengths and limitations. Most studies have reported the superior performance of OBIA on different landscapes such as agricultural areas, forests, urban settlements and wetlands; however, OBIA has challenges such as selecting the optimal segmentation scale, which can result in over or under segmentation, and the low spatial resolution of Landsat images. Other classification methods have the potential to produce accurate classification results when appropriate procedures are followed. More research is needed on the application of hybrid classifiers as they are considered more complex methods for land cover classification.},

The experiment was carried out during the 2013 and 2014 crop seasons at Embrapa Trigo, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. A randomized complete block design was used, with four replicates, and the treatments consisted of five doses of nitrogen topdressing. Plant dry matter, grain yield, and phenology were measured. The canola spectral response was evaluated by measuring the canola canopy reflectance using a spectroradiometer, and, with this data, the SR, NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and GNDVI vegetation indices were determined. Pearson’s correlations between the spectral and biophysical variables of canola showed that the red (620 to 670 nm) and near-infrared (841 to 876 nm) bands were the best to estimate the dry matter. The vegetative period is the most indicated to obtain the most significant correlations for canola. All the used vegetation indices are adequate for estimating the dry matter and grain yield of canola.},

  abstract = {It is of great significance to understand the extent and distribution of bamboo for its valuable ecological services and economic benefits. However, it is challenging to map bamboo using remote sensing images over a large area because of the similarity between bamboo and other vegetation types, the availability of clear optical images, huge workload of image processing, and sample collection. In this study, we use the Landsat 8 times series images archive to map bamboo forests in China via the Google Earth engine. Several spectral indices were calculated and used as classification features, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and textural features of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). We found that the bamboo forest covered an area of 709.92 × 104 hectares, with the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang containing the largest area concentrations. The bamboo forest map was accurate and reliable with an average producer’s accuracy of 89.97\%, user’s accuracy of 78.45\% and kappa coefficient of 0.7789. In addition, bamboo was mainly distributed in forests with an elevation of 300–1200 m above sea level, average annual precipitation of 1200–1500 mm and average day land surface temperature of 19–25 °C. The NDMI is particularly useful in differentiating bamboo from other vegetation because of the clear difference in canopy moisture content, whilst NDVI and elevation are also helpful to improve the bamboo classification accuracy. The bamboo forest map will be helpful for bamboo forest industry planning and could be used for evaluating the ecological service of the bamboo forest.},

  abstract = {We conducted spatiotemporal analyses of urban vegetation structural attributes using multitemporal Landsat TM data and field measurements. We showed that multitemporal TM data has the potential of rapidly estimating urban vegetation structural attributes including LAI, CC , and BA at an urban landscape level. Urban vegetation structural properties/attributes are closely linked to their ecological functions and thus directly affect urban ecosystem process such as energy, water, and gas exchange. Understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of urban vegetation structures is important for sustaining urban ecosystem service and improving the urban environment. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the potential of estimating urban vegetation structural attributes from multitemporal Landsat TM imagery and to analyze spatiotemporal changes of the urban structural attributes. We first collected three scenes of TM images acquired in 1997, 2004, and 2010 and conducted a field survey to collect urban vegetation structural data (including crown closure (CC), tree height (H), leaf area index (LAI), basal area (BA), stem density (SD), diameter at breast height (DBH), etc.). We then calculated and normalized NDVI maps from the multitemporal TM images. Finally, spatiotemporal urban vegetation structural maps were created using NDVI-based urban vegetation structure predictive models. The results show that NDVI can be used as a predictor for some selected urban vegetation structural attributes (i.e., CC, LAI, and BA), but not for the other attributes (i.e., H, SD, and DBH) that are well predicted by NDVI in natural vegetation. The results also indicate that urban vegetation structural attributes (i.e., CC, LAI, and BA) in the study area decreased sharply from 1997 to 2004 but increased slightly from 2004 to 2010. The CC, LAI, and BA class distributions were all skewed toward low values in 1997 and 2004. Moreover, LAI, CC, and BA of urban vegetation all present a decreasing trend from suburban areas to urban central areas. The experimental results demonstrate that Landsat TM imagery could provide a fast and cost-effective method to obtain a spatiotemporal 30-m resolution urban vegetation structural dataset (including CC, LAI, and BA).},

  abstract = {Mapping the distribution and type of land use and land cover (LULC) is essential for watershed management. The Tigris-Euphrates basin is a transboundary region in the Middle East shared between six countries, but a recent fine-scale LULC map of the area is lacking. Using Landsat-8 time series, a 30-m resolution LULC map was produced for the Tigris-Euphrates basin. In total, 1184 Landsat scenes were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE). For the collection of ground truth data, differential manifestations of green cover were considered by dividing the study area into five climatic regions and the training samples were taken from each sub-region. To account for the temporal variation of LULC types, six two-month interval composite layers, including the spectral and thermal bands of Landsat-8, texture and spectral indices, as well as topographic factors were created for the target year 2019. Image segmentation and classification were performed using the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. A computationally effective parallel processing approach was developed, which created a number of tiles and sub-tiles and a bulk command was converted into smaller parallel commands. The generated LULC map showed a satisfactory overall accuracy of 91.7\%, with the highest User’s accuracy in water and wetland, and the lowest in rainfed crop and rangeland and the highest Producer’s accuracy in water and barren areas, and the lowest in garden and rangeland. This study highlights the necessity of using multi-temporal data for LULC mapping, in particular, multi-temporal NDVI, for the separation of different green cover types in arid and semi-arid environment.},

  abstract = {A knowledge of the characteristics of urban green spaces (UGSs) such as their abundance, spatial distribution and species composition, has an important role in a range of fields such as urban geography, urban planning and public health. Remote sensing technologies have made great contributions to the analysis of UGSs. However, a comprehensive review of the current status, challenges and potential in this area is lacking. In this paper, we scrutinize major trends in remote sensing approaches for characterising UGSs and evaluate the effectiveness of different remote sensing systems and analytical techniques. The results suggest that the number of studies focusing on mapping UGSs and classifying species within UGSs have increased rapidly over recent decades. However, there are fewer examples of non-tree species mapping, change detection, biomass and carbon mapping and vegetation health assessment within UGSs. Most studies have focused on UGSs (mainly trees) which cover large areal extents, with fewer studies of smaller patches such as street trees, urban gardens, recreational spaces and public parks, even though collectively such patches can cover substantial areas. Hence, we encourage future investigations to focus on a wider variety of different UGSs, particularly small-scale UGSs. We also recommend that research focuses on developing more effective image time series analysis techniques, methods to capture the complexity of UGSs and the use of SAR in studies of UGSs. At the same time, further research is needed to fully exploit remote sensing data within thematic applications such as monitoring changes in UGSs over time, quantifying biomass and carbon mapping and assessing vegetation health.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a versatile cloud platform in which pixel-based (PB) and object-oriented (OO) Land Use–Land Cover (LULC) classification approaches can be implemented, thanks to the availability of the many state-of-art functions comprising various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. OO approaches, including both object segmentation and object textural analysis, are still not common in the GEE environment, probably due to the difficulties existing in concatenating the proper functions, and in tuning the various parameters to overcome the GEE computational limits. In this context, this work is aimed at developing and testing an OO classification approach combining the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to identify spatial clusters, the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to calculate cluster textural indices, and two ML algorithms (Random Forest (RF) or Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to perform the final classification. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is applied to the main seven GLCM indices to synthesize in one band the textural information used for the OO classification. The proposed approach is implemented in a user-friendly, freely available GEE code useful to perform the OO classification, tuning various parameters (e.g., choose the input bands, select the classification algorithm, test various segmentation scales) and compare it with a PB approach. The accuracy of OO and PB classifications can be assessed both visually and through two confusion matrices that can be used to calculate the relevant statistics (producer’s, user’s, overall accuracy (OA)). The proposed methodology was broadly tested in a 154 km2 study area, located in the Lake Trasimeno area (central Italy), using Landsat 8 (L8), Sentinel 2 (S2), and PlanetScope (PS) data. The area was selected considering its complex LULC mosaic mainly composed of artificial surfaces, annual and permanent crops, small lakes, and wooded areas. In the study area, the various tests produced interesting results on the different datasets (OA: PB RF (L8 = 72.7\%, S2 = 82\%, PS = 74.2), PB SVM (L8 = 79.1\%, S2 = 80.2\%, PS = 74.8\%), OO RF (L8 = 64\%, S2 = 89.3\%, PS = 77.9), OO SVM (L8 = 70.4, S2 = 86.9\%, PS = 73.9)). The broad code application demonstrated very good reliability of the whole process, even though the OO classification process resulted, sometimes, too demanding on higher resolution data, considering the available computational GEE resources.},

  abstract = {Accurate built-up information is imperative for loss estimation and disaster management after the occurrence of catastrophic events such as earthquake, tornado, tsunami and flood. These catastrophic events leave behind a trail of mass destruction with property and human losses amounting to millions. Once a natural disaster hits a region, built-up information is required within a short span of time for disaster management. Nowadays, earth observation satellite imagery serves as a promising source to extract the land use / land cover classes. However, the automatic extraction of urban built-up from remote sensing data is a known challenge in the remote sensing community. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) algorithm has been recognized as an effective algorithm for automatic built-up identification from medium spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Few researchers have modified this algorithm and proposed new quantitative expressions for the built-up index. In this paper, three built-up index based, unsupervised built-up extraction algorithms have been reviewed and compared. An automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm is used to assort the built-up index values, obtained from modified built-up index algorithms, into built-up and non built-up regions for enhancing the efficiency of the built-up detection process. Qualitative assessment of these algorithms involves computation of several parameters including recently developed parameters like allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement, and classical parameters such as error of omission, error of commission and overall accuracy. This paper presents a case study where the algorithms have been implemented on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the city of Delhi and its surrounding areas for detection of built-up regions automatically.},

  abstract = {With the significant progress of urbanization, cities and towns are suffering from air pollution, heat island effects, and other environmental problems. Urban vegetation, especially trees, plays a significant role in solving these ecological problems. To maximize services provided by vegetation, urban tree species should be properly selected and optimally arranged. Therefore, accurate classification of tree species in urban environments has become a major issue. In this paper, we reviewed the potential of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to improve the accuracy of urban tree species classification. In detail, we reviewed the studies using LiDAR data in urban tree species mapping, especially studies where LiDAR data was fused with optical imagery, through classification accuracy comparison, general workflow extraction, and discussion and summarizing of the specific contribution of LiDAR. It is concluded that combining LiDAR data in urban tree species identification could achieve better classification accuracy than using either dataset individually, and that such improvements are mainly due to finer segmentation, shadowing effect reduction, and refinement of classification rules based on LiDAR. Furthermore, some suggestions are given to improve the classification accuracy on a finer and larger species level, while also aiming to maintain classification costs.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need for urban tree classification, in order to assist with ecological environment protection and provide sustainable development guidance for urban planners. While most of the existing studies have concentrated on tree crown extraction or tree species identification, only a few studies have attempted to conduct semantic classification of urban trees from an urban habitat perspective. The lack of semantic information means that it is difficult to meet the needs of ecological and environmental issues. As such, in this study, a novel three-level (pixel-object-patch) framework for semantic classification of urban trees is proposed to categorize urban trees as park, roadside, and residential-institutional trees. These three categories are cognized and conceptualized by humans and serve as different ecological functions in urban areas. Park is important urban greenery accommodated within recreational and cultural facilities. Roadside and residential-institutional trees are distributed along streets or in neighborhoods. The framework for the semantic classification of urban trees includes the following steps: 1) vegetation information extraction at the pixel level utilizing a spectral vegetation index; 2) vegetation-type classification at the object level employing spectral and textural features; and 3) urban tree classification at the patch level, where a series of metrics related to area, shape, structure, and spatial relationship are considered. Two typical Chinese megacities, Shenzhen and Wuhan, were chosen to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory performance, with the overall accuracy reaching 85\%. Moreover, the producer's and user's accuracies are generally high for most tree categories ({$>$}80\%). The further landscape analysis demonstrates some general characteristics of the natural landscape configuration: residential-institutional trees show greater fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity, and park trees show the maximum physical connectedness and aggregation.},

  abstract = {Urban vegetation plays an important role in quality of life. However, accurate urban vegetation maps cannot be easily acquired from multispectral remotely sensed data alone because the spectral bands are indistinct among different vegetation classes. This study aimed to detect urban vegetation categories from IKONOS imagery based on an object-oriented method that can integrate both spectral and spatial information of objects in the classification procedure and thus can improve classification capability. Considering the characteristics of urban vegetation in IKONOS imagery, a two-scale segmentation procedure was designed to obtain ‘objects’, and the feature set for vegetation objects was constructed. Redundant information among the features was then removed by using correlation analysis, the Jeffries–Matusita (J–M) distance and principal component transformation (PCT). Finally, the vegetation objects were identified by the classification and regression tree (CART) model. The results show that IKONOS imagery can be used to map vegetation types with a total accuracy of 87.71\%. Segmentations involving both micro and macro scales could acquire better vegetation objects than using a single scale. The correlation analysis combined with the J–M distance and PCT was efficient in optimizing the feature set. The rule-based classification method is suitable for identifying urban vegetation types using the feature set with a complex structure.}

  abstract = {A significant proportion of high spatial resolution imagery in urban areas can be affected by shadows. Considerable research has been conducted to investigate shadow detection and removal in remotely sensed imagery. Few studies, however, have evaluated how applications of these shadow detection and restoration methods can help eliminate the shadow problem in land cover classification of high spatial resolution images in urban settings. This paper presents a comparison study of three methods for land cover classification of shaded areas from high spatial resolution imagery in an urban environment. Method 1 combines spectral information in shaded areas with spatial information for shadow classification. Method 2 applies a shadow restoration technique, the linear-correlation correction method to create a “shadow-free” image before the classification. Method 3 uses multisource data fusion to aid in classification of shadows. The results indicated that Method 3 achieved the best accuracy, with overall accuracy of 88\%. It provides a significantly better means for shadow classification than the other two methods. The overall accuracy for Method 1 was 81.5\%, slightly but not significantly higher than the 80.5\% from Method 2. All of the three methods applied an object-based classification procedure, which was critical as it provides an effective way to address the problems of radiometric difference and spatial misregistration associated with multisource data fusion (Method 3), and to incorporate thematic spatial information (Method 1).},
